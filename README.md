# pawn
# under pawn/pawn/app/src/main, there are 2 folders and 1 file, java/com/example/pawn/pawn, res, and AndroidManifest.xml.
# java/com/example/pawn/pawn contains all the Java code and activities, which is helpful for UI.
# res contains many folders, the important ones being layout and raw (raw isn't up yet but that is where you can upload the python code).
# res/layout contains 3 activity_main.xml's for the different activity pages. This is where most of the UI should go.
